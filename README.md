# CS-GY 6953 Deep Learning Course Mini-Project 
Jupyter Notebook

The current project presents a simple modified residual network (ResNet) architecture for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The modified model was able to reach more than ninety percent accuracy after few epochs of highly time-efficient training. Major techniques used to improve the model include batch normalization, data augmentation, gradient clipping, adding learning rate scheduler and weight decay. The final version of the model meets the constraint of having no than 5 million parameters.
